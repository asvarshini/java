##This project demonstrates the use of Java Generics to sort arrays of different data types using a single generic method.
It uses bounded type parameters (Comparable) to ensure type safety and applies bubble sort to sort product names (String) and product prices (Double).

The program also includes a generic method to print array elements and allows user selection through console input.
